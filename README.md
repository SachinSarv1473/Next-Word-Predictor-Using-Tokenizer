# Next_Word_Predictor

This project is a Next Word Predictor implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (IPython Notebook). The predictor utilizes a dataset from "metamorphosis_clean.txt" to train a language model and predict the next word based on the input text.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SachinSarv1473/Next_Word_Predictor.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Next_Word_Predictor
```

3. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install numpy tensorflow
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `nextWordPrediction.ipynb`:

```bash
jupyter notebook nextWordPrediction.ipynb
```

2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code cells and train the model.

3. Once the model is trained, you can input (hardcode) a sequence of words to get a prediction for the next word.


## Dataset

The dataset used for training the Next Word Predictor is "metamorphosis_clean.txt", which contains the text of the book "Metamorphosis" by Franz Kafka. The text has been preprocessed to remove punctuation and normalize the text for training.
